# Pi Overrides in Rin

This document explains how to interpret upstream pi documentation when operating inside Rin.

## Rule of precedence

When Rin docs and upstream pi docs overlap:

- prefer Rin docs first
- use upstream pi docs as the base reference only when Rin docs do not override the topic
- if there is any conflict, Rin docs take precedence

## What changes in Rin

### Runtime paths

Do not assume upstream pi runtime paths like `~/.pi/...` apply directly.
In Rin, prefer the stable paths under `~/.rin/...`.
See `docs/runtime-layout.md` for the authoritative layout.

### Memory

Rin provides its own markdown-backed memory system and prompt integration.
Do not assume upstream pi memory behavior or prompt injection rules apply unchanged.
See `docs/capabilities.md` for agent-facing behavior.

### Builtin capabilities

Rin registers additional builtin capabilities such as web search, fetch, memory, subagent, scheduled tasks, and chat bridge helpers directly in core.
Do not reason from upstream pi defaults alone.
See `docs/builtin-extensions.md` and `docs/capabilities.md`.

### Documentation paths

Rin installs stable documentation under:

- `~/.rin/docs/rin/...`
- `~/.rin/docs/pi/...`

Prefer these stable installed paths over release-specific paths.

### Rin-specific behavior

When the task involves Rin runtime behavior, launcher layout, daemon behavior, memory, scheduled tasks, chat bridge behavior, or other Rin-owned features, read Rin docs first and treat them as authoritative.

## Recommended reading order

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/pi-overrides.md`
3. the relevant topic document such as `docs/runtime-layout.md`, `docs/builtin-extensions.md`, or `docs/capabilities.md`
4. upstream pi docs only as needed, with Rin overrides in mind
