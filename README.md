# Rin

Rin is a daemon-style local AI assistant built on Pi.
It is terminal-first, keeps a small customizable core, and ships with a practical default toolset.

> [!WARNING]
> Rin is still a work in progress.
> Expect rough edges, unstable behavior, and occasional breaking changes.
> Agentic workflows can also consume noticeable model tokens and cost depending on how you use them.

## Why Rin

- Built on Pi and shaped into a daemon agent you can keep around for daily work.
- Small core by design: easier to understand, customize, and maintain.
- Practical built-ins for file work, memory, scheduled tasks, web search, and chat bridging.
- One product entrypoint: `rin`.
- KISS-first direction instead of a sprawling extension-first surface.

## What Rin is good for

Rin is for people who want a local assistant they can actually keep using.

- Ask in plain language.
- Inspect and modify files.
- Keep useful long-term memory.
- Run reminders and recurring tasks.
- Look up fresh information on the web.
- Bridge the same assistant into chat platforms.

## Quick start

Install with one command, no clone required:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh -s -- --beta
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh -s -- --nightly
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh -s -- --git
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh -s -- --git main
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinchanai/rin/bootstrap/install.sh | sh -s -- --git deadbeef
```

The public bootstrap branch now only carries the install and update entry wrappers. Stable installs and updates hand off to the published npm package, while `--beta`, `--nightly`, and `--git` continue to resolve through the bootstrap manifest and GitHub refs.

If you already have the repo locally, the bundled `install.sh` wrapper runs the same release-selection flow:

```bash
./install.sh              # stable release (default)
./install.sh --beta       # current weekly beta candidate
./install.sh --nightly    # current nightly build
./install.sh --git        # main
./install.sh --git main
./install.sh --git deadbeef
```

Open Rin:

```bash
rin
```

Check health if needed:

```bash
rin doctor
```

## Built in today

Rin includes a focused default stack:

- file and shell tools
- long-term memory
- scheduled tasks and reminders
- live web search
- chat bridge support
- subagents for delegated work

## Updating Rin

For a normal installed Rin update, use:

```bash
rin update              # stable release (default)
rin update --beta       # current weekly beta candidate
rin update --nightly    # current nightly build
rin update --git        # main
rin update --git main
rin update --git deadbeef
```

If `rin` is confirmed missing on the current account, treat that as “this is not the launcher-owning user”.
In that case, recover the real target install through the installed metadata described in `docs/rin/docs/runtime-layout.md`:

- `<targetHome>/.rin/installer.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/systemd/user/rin-daemon*.service`
- macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rin.daemon.*.plist`

Then invoke the stable installed runtime entry directly:

```bash
node <installDir>/app/current/dist/app/rin/main.js update -u <targetUser>
```

This is the canonical update path for the installed runtime.
It refreshes the core runtime and installed docs.
It does not replace the user-scoped CLI launcher or installer.

Important release-channel rule:
- stable is the default for install and update
- `--beta` means the current weekly beta candidate
- `--nightly` means the current nightly build from `main`
- `--git` with no suffix means `main`

Avoid treating repo-local workflows like `git pull`, ad-hoc rebuilds, or rerunning `install.sh` as the default way to update an already installed Rin.

## Core commands

```bash
rin            # open Rin
rin doctor     # inspect health and configuration
rin start      # start the daemon
rin stop       # stop the daemon
rin restart    # restart the daemon
rin update     # update the installed Rin core runtime
```

## Testing

Rin keeps repository tests in three buckets:

- `tests/unit`: fast isolated checks for one module or behavior
- `tests/e2e`: cross-process flows that still run in a disposable environment
- `tests/interactive`: opt-in smoke coverage for terminal interaction paths

The placement and design rules for new tests live in [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

## Docs

Start here:

- [`docs/rin/README.md`](docs/rin/README.md)
- [`docs/rin/docs/capabilities.md`](docs/rin/docs/capabilities.md)
- [`docs/rin/docs/runtime-layout.md`](docs/rin/docs/runtime-layout.md)

- [`docs/rin/docs/first-stable-release-checklist.md`](docs/rin/docs/first-stable-release-checklist.md)
- [`upstream/pi/README.md`](upstream/pi/README.md) for the tracked upstream Pi mirror used by Rin
- [`upstream/skill-creator/SKILL.md`](upstream/skill-creator/SKILL.md) for the tracked upstream builtin skill mirror used by Rin

Refresh the mirrored upstream assets when needed:

```bash
npm run sync:upstreams
```

You can also refresh one mirror at a time:

```bash
npm run sync:pi-docs
npm run sync:skill-creator
```

## Project status

Rin is actively evolving.
The current direction is a cleaner core, stronger daemon reliability, and better day-to-day usefulness without losing simplicity.

If you want a fully settled surface, it is still early.
If you want a small, understandable, hackable daemon agent that is already useful, that is what Rin is trying to be.
